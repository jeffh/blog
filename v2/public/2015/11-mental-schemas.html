  <div class="post-content"><p>It is difficult to always be improving in the software industry. In creative
fields, many artists <a href="https://youtu.be/ikAb-NYkseI?t=9m41s">talk</a> about
<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/309485-nobody-tells-this-to-people-who-are-beginners-i-wish">churn</a>.
When starting out, there&rsquo;s an enormous amount of work to produce to get better.
If you&rsquo;re new, there&rsquo;s a massive amount of bad code you need to write. That&rsquo;s
OK, it&rsquo;s necessary. But the rate of improvement decays as time progresses. As
your notoriety grows, you can no longer just crank out code to get better, how
can you preserve some rate of improvement? It feels like the rate of learning
looks like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="11-mental-schemas/expert-growth-graph.jpeg" alt="Experiential Growth Graph"  />
</p>
<p>Why does it go down? We can speculate. Old information conflicts with newer
information. Experienced engineers get promoted beyond the engineering and their
knowledge goes stale. How does an experienced individual get technically
stronger? Let&rsquo;s throw a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore related fields</li>
<li>Study more in depth the current field</li>
<li>Teach what you know</li>
</ul>
<p>These strategies provide a different kind of &ldquo;churn&rdquo;. They look less like the
traditional work of programming, but they provide more leverage, prestige, and
challenges. It&rsquo;s not too different from management.</p>
<p>The benefits of exploring existing, related fields is obvious: the expert
becomes a beginner again. A beginner&rsquo;s mind reopens vulnerability that experts
have long eliminated, and too many avoid. Different experiences provide
different perspectives to your craft. It&rsquo;s why diverse teams are better than
mono-cultured ones. An example is artificial intelligence, where most of the
successful algorithms are based on neuroscience. That doesn&rsquo;t preclude you from
working in your current field, but it&rsquo;s a way to curate ideas and techniques you
wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise have.</p>
<p>While exploring other fields is much easier to learn a breath of information.
Narrowing solidifies the knowledge already known. It&rsquo;s similar to starting out
as a civil engineer before learning physics. The engineering brings practical
experience to theory. It provides intuition to theoretical concepts. This fills
gaps in your knowledge both in known boundaries and unexplored territories. It&rsquo;s
a two-way street, as theory is also improved through practice. Personally, this
deep dive creates an exciting dilemma: we know so little in most areas. This is
both good and bad. Bad since we have so little concrete knowledge. Good since
it&rsquo;s easy to contribute to the pool of human knowledge. This much applies to
every industry, for every specialty. It doesn&rsquo;t take long to get to the edge of
human knowledge in one particular field.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, teaching is another form of learning. Learning something
gives you a unique opportunity to do one thing: explain what was the tipping
point to make you understand something in the first place. Teaching is one of
the best ways to capture fleeting knowledge. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m happy to work with
newcomers - they&rsquo;re sometimes more helpful to me than I am to them. Like
debaters that forge their arguments in battle, I&rsquo;ve sharpened my thought by
explaining my ideas to others. It&rsquo;s far less confrontational too, if that&rsquo;s not
quite your thing. In short, brilliance without collaboration is impossible.
Helping is definitely mutual.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are overlapping similarities behind executing on these tactics. In fact,
it&rsquo;s similar to how many started out in this industry. <strong>Work on interesting
projects</strong>. That&rsquo;s why you grew. There happened to be more knowledge to absorb
at the time. Those tactics are parts of what made you become an expert in the
first place. Many times people let their knowledge decay too far into ruin,
instead of finding ways to build upon their knowledge.</p>
<p>I happen to draw experience from many past projects. From using tools like
Photoshop, Flash, and 3DS Max. Then writing games in C++, C#, and Python in game
jams. Or implementing game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">algorithms</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)">top of</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man">classic</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command">games</a>. Haphazardly, learn some
screencasting software to teach
<a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/diving-into-django--net-2969">Django</a> or
present how to
<a href="http://pivotallabs.com/jeff-hui-reverse-engineering-objective-c/">reverse engineer</a>.
<a href="http://yacs.me">Build a site</a> that provides utility, then use that site&rsquo;s data
to visualize in <a href="http://d3js.org">d3</a>. Then re-deploy the site in a
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">half</a>-<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">dozen</a>
<a href="http://capistranorb.com">different</a> <a href="http://www.fabfile.org">ways</a>
<a href="https://puppetlabs.com">to</a> <a href="http://chef.io">understand</a>
<a href="http://saltstack.com">devops</a>. And there&rsquo;s also writing on this very
blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of projects. I&rsquo;ve accidentally stumbled into many of them with an
irresistible excitement. Others were like trudging through mud of demotivation.
Interesting doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you&rsquo;ll love it, but it may expand your
empathy for <a href="http://www.monodevelop.com">developers</a>
<a href="http://www.vim.org">coming</a>
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">from</a> a
<a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/visual-studio-homepage-vs.aspx">different</a>
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">perspective</a>.</p>
<p>These projects <em>will</em> be frustrating. Some will be unfruitful; some of my
projects were never finished. But it&rsquo;s the fastest way I know how to learn. But
the project has to be motivating enough to drive through the tough challenges.
You need to trick yourself that the end goal is worth it, even though it&rsquo;s only
the journey that matters.</p>
<hr>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this advice the same as when you&rsquo;re a beginner? Almost. You need to do
more while working on these projects: think.</p>
<p>You must mentally refactor what you learn. That helps when you need to explain
the concepts you&rsquo;ve learned or how to build mental models of new, similar
concepts. Try to derive mental schemas you can reapply in different contexts.
Learn
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns#Patterns_by_Type">good object-oriented design patterns</a>,
then learn functional patterns. Try to describe
<a href="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/11/24/FPvsOO.html">OO patterns as functional ones</a>
and vice versa<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Try explaining coding
style to a non-developer.</p>
<p>Why build schemas? They&rsquo;re abstractions for the mind. They let you skip the
implementation detail if needed. Engineers focus on the tools and the languages
too often. Those things all have one thing in common: it&rsquo;s knowledge that
<em>decays</em>. Tools will always change; programming languages come and go. Building
schemas is extracting your experience from the tools and languages you use. It&rsquo;s
high-density knowledge. To refine your schemas, you need to refactor your
tool-specific knowledge. Instead of being an expert at one tool, could you
generalize this skill to be better at a class of tools?</p>
<p>An example is working in a strongly-typed language. I tend to apply
typed-language designs into other programs - even if it&rsquo;s in a dynamically-typed
language. Likewise in avoiding mutation and
<a href="http://inessential.com/2015/05/22/how_not_to_crash_4_threading">multi-threading</a> -
it improves understanding of the program.</p>
<p>After using many languages, you become relatively ignorant of syntax. Instead,
you&rsquo;ll be scanning for larger patterns. Become the chess master that can
<a href="http://theinvisiblegorilla.com/blog/2012/02/15/how-experts-recall-chess-positions/">recall layouts of chess positions</a>
through higher-level patterns instead of the beginner trying to memorize the
location of every piece.</p>
