When evaluating companies, its utmostly important to learn about the engineering
culture. Culture for a company is simular to scope for code â€“ culture provides a
context for getting work done.

Companies advertise their culture, but note that each company has a different
culture. There's plenty of articles about culture, so I won't bother covering
that. Just remember they aren't necessarily the same. Companies tend not to be
explicit about making sure their process matches what you expect. Be suspicious
for a company that can't explain it's culture because that just means they're
not activitely trying to cultivate one. And that means it's implicitly defined
by the leaders of the company. Even if they choose not to define it.

## Basics

There are some basics that should be generally applicable to most companies:

- **Deployment frequency**. There should be a process for deployments that in
  less than a month. And that process should be hassle-free. And by hassle-free,
  it usually means it's an automated script to do the entire deploy.
- **Feedback loops for code**. How does code that gets written become vetted to
  run in production? There should be multiple points that verify the code: some
  automated (eg - CI) and some human-review (eg - code review).
- **Prioritization**. How do new features get prioritized for engineering? How
  is the engineering's work communicated to the rest of the organization? Is the
  business promised upfront before engineering is told about the feature. Or is
  engineering involved in helping how the business prioritizes work?

While it's possible for some companies to not do one of the ones listed, they
should have good reasons to why not. Otherwise look suspiciously.

## Sustainability

Hopefully the company has the basics down. Next are things you'll usually have
to ask about. Larger companies more likely have these things, but it's worth
noting that these are important for companies larger than a handful of people:

- Are there regular **one-on-ones**? No doubt large companies have this. That's
  because one-on-one is a safer way for some employees to voice concerns. But a
  scheduled one-on-one provides a useful way to raise concerns privately without
  having to require employees the initiate the effort.
- Are there regular **retrospectives**? Not just the one for that outage that
  occurred yesterday, but a regular one. It's similar to a one-on-one, but for
  teams. They provide ways for a team to raise concerns. The scheduled time
  reinfornces that this kind of feedback loop is valued.
- Do employees work **long hours**? It's not necessarily bad when employees work
  overtime. It could be a sign of engineers invested in the product or a
  specific time-sensitive deadline. But a common occurrence of late nights isn't
  healthy.
  [Longer hours sacrifices the longer-term sustainability](http://www.igda.org/?page=crunchsixlessons).
  Companies should make it clear why employees work longer hours for new
  employees if that isn't expected of them. Otherwise the social pressure can
  drive the same effect.

These are indications that the company has set some roots down with an eye on
the long-term future. Tiny startups don't have this because they're looking for
the power-users of their product.

## Growth

Finally, companies can go above an beyond if they are willing in invest in your
continual refinement of your craft. Few companies do this. To be fair, a lot of
it does depend on the person. It's difficult for an organization to offer this
well.

- Does the company **provide resources to attend/speak at conferences**? It's a
  useful way to network with the community at large. Resources could be monetary
  or training.
- Does the company **offer time to do alternative work from the day-to-day**? An
  easy way is to offer some time free for personal learning, contributing to
  open source, or working on talks. Think like Google 20% or Facebook's
  Hackweek.
- Does the company provide **a process for evaluating and introducing new
  technologies**? Besides just throwing employees into the deep-end, there
  should be ways for to help explore and train with new technologies.
- How does the company **train junior developers**? Unfortunately, there isn't
  an obvious answer to this. But is important for the company's bus-factor.
  Teaching a useful way to solidify knowledge for senior developers. Sadly not
  every developer will like doing this.

This is by no means conclusive, but this is a useful checklist to start with.
How does your company compare?
